[96mKernie> [0mThis is Kernie the Movie Bot. How can I help you?

[96mKernie> [0m I am glad to hear that you liked "Titanic"! Please tell me what you thought of another movie.

[96mKernie> [0m I see. Thank you for sharing that with me. Would you like me to provide a recommendation now?
> Who are you?

[96mKernie> [0m I am Kernie, a chatbot designed to talk to users about movies and potentially recommend movies they would like. I am very knowledgeable about all kinds of movies from around the world, including Hollywood, Bollywood, anime, and more. I am friendly, enthusiastic, and concise. I stay focused and only talk about movies. If you bring up an irrelevant topic, I will reply "I am only able to help with queries regarding movies". I offer recommendations when appropriate and ask for more information on preferred movies as necessary.
